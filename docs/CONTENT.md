**Who We Are**

## Content

Stadium Assembly is part of The Apostolic Church Nigeria, a fellowship rooted in Scripture, prayer, and Christian community. We've been serving the Ogbomosho community for many years, and our mission remains the same: to share the love of Jesus and help people grow in their faith.

**Our Mission**

We exist to proclaim the Word of God faithfully, raise disciples grounded in truth, and serve our community with love and compassion.

**Our Vision**

We dream of a church where every person — young or old, new or experienced — feels at home and is equipped to live out their faith in everyday life.

**What We Believe**

- The Bible is God's inspired Word and our guide for life
- Salvation comes through faith in Jesus Christ alone
- Prayer is powerful and changes things
- The Holy Spirit is active and present today
- We are called to love God and love people

**Our Leadership**

Stadium Assembly is led by G. Pastor Bode, under the oversight of The Apostolic Church Nigeria. Our leadership is committed to teaching the Bible clearly, caring for the congregation, and building a church that honours God.

Sermons

## Headline

**Listen and Learn**

## Content

We believe that God speaks through His Word. Every Sunday, our services include a message from the Bible — practical, encouraging, and relevant to everyday life.

If you've never been to our church before, listening to a sermon is a great way to get a feel for who we are and what we teach. You're welcome to browse through our past messages below.

Each sermon includes:

- The message title
- The preacher's name
- The date it was delivered
- A link to watch on YouTube

Take your time. Listen to one or two. We hope these messages encourage you, challenge you, and draw you closer to God.

## Sermon List

_(Sermons will be listed here — title, preacher, date, and link to video)_

## Call to Action

There's nothing quite like being there in person. The music, the fellowship, the atmosphere — it's an experience you can't fully get through a screen.
