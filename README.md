## Design Principles

### Semantic HTML

Every element uses the appropriate HTML tag for its purpose. Headings follow a logical hierarchy, sections are clearly labeled, and accessibility is considered throughout.

### Mobile-First Responsive CSS

The stylesheet includes breakpoints for tablets (768px) and mobile phones (480px). Layouts adapt gracefully from desktop to mobile.

### Reusable Components

CSS classes are designed to be reused across pages. Common patterns like `.section-dark`, `.btn-primary`, and `.ministry-card` maintain consistency.

### Beginner-Friendly Code Comments

The codebase includes extensive comments explaining:

- What each section does
- Why certain CSS techniques are used
- How overlays and positioning work
- Tips for future modifications
